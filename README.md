Notebook that was used to preprocess some data and check if there are any corelations between pokemon type and it's mean RGB value
i'm using Database from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types
Next step of this project is to find the dominant color by using histogram and check if there is any corelation
